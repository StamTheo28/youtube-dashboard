I don't mind Kojima not working on the MGSD since there was a lot of bad blood between Kojima and Konami, at best it's going to be handled by some of Kojima's team who were left behind. All they got to do for me is just up the graphics, improve the gameplay/controls, and don't change the story like they did with 5 and we good.

I originally got back into retro gaming back in 2012 and got hooked up big time by one of my coworkers. He gave me a nes with multiple controllers, 40ish nintendo carts, 60ish genesis carts and a few random Sega cd games that I couldn't care less about.  He's the reason I love rocket knight adventure.  I never knew of that game as a kid.  I lost all of those in a house fire back in 2017. I didn't think I wanted to collect again and just went modern and primarily digital.

n4xPu72QJsI,"I love bows in video games. I've been playing a ton of Splatoon 3, and have always been a huge Zelda fan. Using motion controls for bow combat has been an amazing experience.

Though I heard of Horizon, I didn't really know much about them. I happened upon a video of some high-level gameplay in Forbidden West, and realized that the combat centers around bows. I was instantly hooked.

I've never owned a PlayStation (sad, I know) and been out of the Xbox game for a while now. Always been a Nintendo kid.

But watching your videos on Zero Dawn has felt like a journey, watching this incredible story unfold. I'm hooked. I want to keep going, but also want to save the story for myself to experience someday, but don't think I'll be able to make the time or money for another console for some time.

Either way, thank you for sharing your gameplay of this incredible game. Allows me to experience it without the means to play it myself. That's something at least, and I am grateful!",Gameplay walkthroughs,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-adventure_game,0.194230769,Positive

Before that I played for a lot prize money as a high schooler getting anywhere between $150-500 per tournament. Tallying up my earnings it ended up being 9,275 USD in less than 8 months. It may not seem like a lot compared to what players make now as professionals, but for a higher schooler who played over 75+ tournaments I can say it took a toll and it wasn't even ""pro."" I wanted to hit pro and go higher when I graduated high school due to that injury it crippled me not only physically... more mentally. You could see yourself get worse, worse, and worse as time goes by. The burnout is super serious which is why I support Esports whenever I can.

Problem is lots of game companies are focusing on graphics far more than the gameplay now. Everything must have the most highly detailed graphics and then they use whatever power is left to actually run the gameplay mechanics.

Even low end pcs can reach 60fps in games if they lower the graphics settings on them. When they come out with PS6 they will still have the exact same excuse that games can't run at 60fps but we will for sure have 4k(probably 8k options becoming more common), raytracing, every strand of hair is highly detailed and everything else. I too would give up graphical quality just to get 60 frames per second because the graphics already look good, phenomenal even in games like horizon forbidden west and it still runs at 60fps.",Gaming news,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_game,0.183809524,Positive

I started doing 1v7 just to make things interesting, but even that got boring. I started trying to find the best players and take them on, but I was eitther disapointed or I couldnt find them. Lately, my interest in the game has been re-invigorated due to the rise of players that have surpassed my greatest feat of making the fastest build. I want to take them all on now, though I lack the means to do so for reasons beyond my control. I am still searching for a way to take them on. I want them to beat me so I can find the limits I so desparetely want to surpass.

7xlXTW5CuPY,"The Atlanta Falcons have been busy during the 2023 NFL draft, selecting several promising players to bolster their roster. With a mix of offensive and defensive picks, the Falcons are looking to improve on their record from last season and make a push for the playoffs.

First Round Pick: Offensive Tackle

The Falcons used their first-round pick to select an offensive tackle, addressing a position of need for the team. The player they selected is known for his size and strength, which should help protect the quarterback and improve the team's running game.

Second and Third Round Picks: Defensive Players

In the second and third rounds, the Falcons focused on improving their defense. They selected a linebacker and a defensive end, both of whom are known for their speed and athleticism. The Falcons hope these players will help them improve their pass rush and limit their opponents' scoring.

Fourth Round Pick: Wide Receiver

The Falcons added some depth to their receiving corps with their fourth-round pick. The player they selected is known for his speed and agility, which should make him a valuable asset in the team's passing game.

Fifth and Sixth Round Picks: Offensive Players

In the fifth and sixth rounds, the Falcons added two more players to their offense. They selected a running back and a tight end, both of whom are known for their versatility and ability to make plays. The Falcons hope these players will help them improve their running game and give the quarterback more options in the passing game.

Seventh Round Pick: Defensive Tackle

The Falcons used their final pick of the draft to select a defensive tackle. The player they selected is known for his size and strength, which should help the team improve its run defense. The Falcons hope this player will be a valuable asset in stopping their opponents' running game.

Overall, the Falcons had a successful draft, adding several promising players to their roster. With a mix of offensive and defensive picks, the team is looking to improve on last season's record and make a push for the playoffs. Only time will tell if these draft picks will pan out, but the Falcons are hopeful that they have added some valuable assets to their team.",Movie trailers,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football,-0.024330357,Negative

When Durant arrived, it was a mismatch and GSW wins back-to-back.  Then the major season ending injuries piled for their stars and they don't even make the playoffs for 2 seasons.  Even with Klay back in 2021-2022, he was still hampered by the recovery and long lay-off.  But they managed to win the chip that season.  That for me was Curry at its finest.

The team also has players who have very strong winning attitudes. The guys help each other out. They support each other. They don't throw each other under the bus. All the guys on the team have really good attitudes. That includes MPJ, Gordon, KCP, Bruce Brown, Christian Braun, Jamal, Jokic, etc. The guys really do work hard, don't feel sorry for themselves, and work to stay focused. I think it helps a lot that Jokic has a very strong work ethic and Murray is very competitive and determined.

1C7lb89kl-8,"One example about Chinese manufacturing being more than just cheap labor is Cigarette lighters: How cheap can you make a lighter?
It doesn't have to be anything fancy, just a boring generic plastic product that is (1) able to light things up, and (2) as cheap as possible.
The BIC(French) lighters costs 16 US cents back in 1987, now they are around 20 cents apiece to manufacture.
On the other hand, modern Chinese manufacturers are making them at a cost just under 2 US cents apiece, and if you are willing to pay for shipping you can get them at ~3 cents apiece in bulk today.
At that price level you can't afford any low-level workers, and instead everything has to be automated.
You can't cut corners too far either because even a 1% defect rate is going to cost more than the savings from the cut corners.

Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
I hear her voice in the mornin' hour, she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Drivin' down the road, I get a feelin'
That I should've been home yesterday, yesterday
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama

Analog Lab Intro seems to work; I select instruments, press keys with the mouse, and hear sound.  When I do, the Minilab 3 shows which instrument has been selected, but pressing keys on the Minilab 3 does nothing.  I've selected 'Arturia' with Shift-Prog but it doesn't move keys/knobs/faders on the Analog Lab screen.

Will you make something similar to Murder (dust) or Horror (or even Killer)?
Two years ago, you already made music for those three. But, would there be a musical video for them, that explains their struggle and misery? Like, how Murder tried everything he could within those 300+ resets (or whatever was the number. And he never used the souls, probably because he doesn't know where they are and he couldn't even use them, if he found) and how he finally decided to do his own genocide? How he literally kills ""the human"" for hundred of times, only to die later and remember his failed attempt. How he would try to get a better progress this time and would change the pattern of his attacks, just to make a living hell for ""the human""? How he literally torture them sometimes? How he understands that, what he is doing - is useless, but he would never give up. (And, if we take into consideration that he despises Killer and would never WILLINGLY join nightmare, that he hates being in the team? And how he is friendly with horror, seeing him as a kindred spirit). There are a lot of things that I can try to say about Dust (Murder) or Horror, but why would I, if I don't know if you already has this information or not",Music videos,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music,0.026923077,Positive

NdEILhW_sKA,"üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èTHE TECHNIQUEüëÅÔ∏è
The goal of this technique is to activate your Pineal and Pituitary Glands/ Third Eye. You must realize that the metaphysical experience is the direct result of a physical process that you force to occur within your body. Begin by laying down in a safe place. Do a basic meditation to relax your body and clear your mind. Once you are relaxed, you are going to start squeezing and expanding your brain. Your brain is attached to muscles and tendons that let you expand and squeeze it. Bring your focus to your forehead and try squeezing and expanding your frontal lobe. Concentrate and keep trying until you can get it. Once you can feel it moving then move to the center of your brain, (this is where the glands are located, the Eye of RA) and do the same thing. Squeeze then stretch it out, feel it expand as if past your skull, squeeze, expand... After a few minutes move to the back lower area of your brain where the Claustrum is located. This is where the Sacred Oil is produced by mixing the fluids from the two glands. Do the same, squeeze, expand over and over. Once you get the hang of it, start doing it in a wave motion from the frontal lobe to the bottom of the claustrum. Continue squeezing and expanding repeatedly until you can start to feel the fluids moving, such as mucus running down the back of your throat. Some people, myself included, experience something that sounds and feels like a crust breaking off the outside of your brain, this is normal. The objective is to get your brain working, you have never used it like this before. Once you get the fluids moving you want to push the Oil from the Claustrum down the back of the spine, down your nervous system and back up the front. Using your back muscles, push the fluid down the back of your spine to the bottom. Then squeeze your muscles in your lower area like your buttocks and sphincter to start pushing the fluid up the front of your spine. Men as well as women have kegel muscles, use these like a pump. Suck in your stomach and your chest muscles, push the back of your tongue up to help push the fluid up the front of your spine into your brain, pumping the fluid up the front of the nervous system into the Thalamus, the seat of God. Continue repeating this pattern, from the front of your brain to the back of your brain, down the back of your spine to the bottom, and up the front of your spine into your brain. Repeat this process as long as you can. When I did this I was not staring at a clock but it felt like an hour. Realistically I would say 15 to 30 minutes. I did it until all of a sudden I couldn't close my eyes! Not even to blink. This lasted for several minutes. At first I thought I broke my brain! As soon as I was able to relax enough to barely close my eyes, I slipped...  
Some things to note: 
1. I know to a lot of people this sounds weird, (like it's not already weird) but you need to make sure that the Moon is in your Sun Star sign. The Moon affects the fluids in your body and helps the Oil be created. 
2. The ancient gnostic text talk about sexual abstinence in order to get this to work. I refrained from having sex for two weeks before I did this.
3. Make sure you are in a good place in your head and that you have pure thoughts. Because if you don't, you won't go all the way to the end and meet the Light. 
4. If this does not work the first time, try decalcifying your brain for six months and then come back and try again. I put in a reverse osmosis machine under my kitchen sink for $150.00 and I quit using fluoride toothpaste. Fluoride calcifies the pineal gland, which is what we are trying to activate. 
5. This last one is a WARNING. Working on yourself is PARAMOUNT beforehand so that you have the best positive experience you can. Also, you need those skills for afterwards. I was super high for about 2 weeks and then I became insanely negative. It took a lot of hard work to crawl out of that hole and then maintain the connection, so you need to be prepared for that mentally. SUICIDE HAS OCCURRED IN THE UNPREPARED. THIS IS LIFE CHANGING. Make sure you have some good meditation techniques. Maybe have a friend handy to lean on a little.
In my experience I was granted one wish, I wanted to be emotionally healed from the damage caused by being an innocent man on death row. I was also gifted with a vision. The Chrystal Light Being touched my heart in order to heal it so that I could love my family properly, and it showed me that everyone on Earth has this Light Being inside of them. Everyone will have their own experience. This is how to have a true Kundalini Awakening, but it's also called the Anointing of the Christ/Chrism Oil, the return of Christ is the return of this knowledge to you. This is what it means to have Christ in you inorder to enter Heaven, it's something you do while you are alive. Email me at jcchrism at yahoo. com for a free pdf with more info. Good luck my friend. 
I love you‚ù§Ô∏è

I found you due to Triumph and kinda just stopped following what you make after Parasitic Funk came out just cause I got other stuff to do (still had basically every song of yours on my spotify playlist) and recently found Chromatica and saw you made it! Basically everything I was doing was thrown away and I just listened to everything you made in the past like, year and a half, and now this banger!

Changing neuro associative conditionings 

if you want to be a success in life the  first belief you need is realizing that you cant do it alone you need universal mind,  second is realizing  you can only attract universal mind with people around you, their energies, and their thoughts will attract god. Trust me god saved me it will help you. 

Next thing is the way of pain and pleasure in your mind, it is the source of matrix, and there is a part of brain that environmental mind can bring unique ideas there which will help you to avoid the pain and reach the pleasure !!  Once you realize this you will be a wise person .
 make life time changes in yourself you must fear being among fools while willing being among wise - the best way to waste youth is to be among those who share same ideas with us
The most difficult thing is to change yourself so  why not ask god and its attraction by energies that people thoughts make so god can help you
The distance between earth and heaven is one single thought 
There are 3 kind of people those who seek wisdom , those seek honor and those seek gain

I am your God And Lord. Kindness is powerful than fear 
Humans must die all of us must die unless provided with the power to change ourselves naturally if we are not provided then this is the end of the road so ask gods ask gods we must have the ability to change ourselves naturally i cant change my self without struggle it would have been  nice if we had have the natural ability to change ourselves so we must have that ability or end of the road",Meditation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music,0.201519574,Positive

its probably me but curious what people did for this - if i cant use this main knob to change the presets of the the mini v - im gonna be a lil disappointed - i get i have to map 3rd party plugins - but it should be automatic with arturia things 

maybe im just acting entitled? - enlighten me",Software tutorials,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music,0.081666667,Positive

But Traces of Death is 100% real and has various categories of real death and/or gore such as automobile accidents, murder, suicide, animal attacks etc
2) Orozco the Embalmer - documentary about an embalmer in Columbia, following as he does his job. He's show ""fixing"" messed-up corpses and seems to hate his job. The area is so poverty stricken that he has to stuff the bodies with things like rags and old newspaper.
3) Black Metal Veins - Documentary following a group of heroin (and often also crack) addicts who are SUPER into black metal music
4) Earthlings - This is about predominately the meat industry in the United States, but also all things humans do to animals. This is one of the most upsetting things I have ever seen in my life and details footage (mostly recorded secretly by undercover reporters) of extremely poor living conditions and just THE most HORRIFIC torture and abuse.

xvDuqW9SFT8,"No such thing as talent.  There is only practice excluding the brain damaged guy who can remember anything he reads but can't figure out how to do anything on his own.  These child prodigies are simply abused kids.  There is a lot more to child abuse than just hitting them.  Nothing worse than a goal post that constantly moves as the kid tries desperately to please their parents.  Most parents do this to some degree but the goal post is logical and generalized.  Even still normal kids aren't isolated and begin to realize that their own goal posts take priority and parents generally see this as rebellion but it's expected and normal.
   You could take some kid from the poorest, lowest educated slum in any country at the age of 3.  Isolate them from other kids at the age of 3, and make them practice piano an hour a day, violin a hour a day, and study math and science for a hour a day.  By the age of 7 their abilities will make them a ""Child Prodigy"" but their future will be extremely bleak and empty mostly of all the social things that make humans happy.
   You find a lot of extremely talented people who grew up with no other kids around.  I know I'm very talented and socially inept because when there are no other kids around 90% of your life you become good at doing whatever you fill your time with.  For me it was computers my father started me on at age 3.  When people tell me how talented I am at computers I roll my eyes and it gives me no pleasure.  I just remember hours and hours of computer work throughout my life.
   Same reason a master pianist smirks when someone says how talented they are because they remember all the piano practice and all the things they were forced or chose perhaps to sacrifice for that practice to have this ""talent"".   There is no talent, only hard work and dedication.  That's great for adults, bad for kids who are easily manipulated in subtle ways by parents.",Documentaries,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment,0.132948718,Positive

5B31N7r9tVs,"üíØ% here for your subtle sexy South Western‚ù§. Legit connections to this legacy. ü§†My father & his parents came from working CA farms & ranches. They identified heavily into this culture, üìª listening to the plight of the simple workingmanüé∂, wanting to celebrate after üí™laboring awayüçª. Grew up loving it & feeling that soul deep connection to my redneck peeps in trendy üé¨tinsel town.

We also lived in an üêéequestrian & 
üêÑlivestocküêì suburb in the Valley. Used to muck out üí© stalls to be able ride neighbor's üê¥horses on our local trails. 
üòòLater, did the 90s boot scootin', romantic üíï waltzing, & swingy üíû two-stepping in swooshy skirts, low black leather ankle booties, & a summery black faux fashion cowboy hat w/matching band.

Nowadays, I feel rather foolishüòî in too much cowgirl gear. Too costumey. Gotta tone it down ‚¨áÔ∏è. Will wear a longer fit & flare skirt, but now wear w/nude suede ankle boots. ‚òÄÔ∏èIn our triple digit heat, the tallerüë¢boots are added miseryü•µ. 

ü§óAlthough your squared toed Chelsea boots are pretty spectatularüí´. Recently bought a üê´camel colored knee-high fringed flat boot on clearance w/a similar toe silhouetteüëç. Thought they'd look cute w/tonal riding pants, body-con tee, & some kind of üÜíÔ∏è duster length topper (say a long white collared shirt dress). ü§îMight get 1-2 chances to wear 'em yet.

For üé§country concertsüéª, there will be no tiered off-the-shoulder boho blouses for meüôÑ. Instead, I will go for a coordinating undershirt type ribbed tank & a delicately crochet cropped cardi.

üòÅYour bandana & belt are nice nod to the trend. Your black wide straight brimmed hat is on fire‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•.  Loosely reminds me of  üéûClint Eastwood's Sharpshooter hat w/the braided trim. This brim seems more modern & versatile.

RE Moto Trend. üñ§Love the boots w/o the exaggerated details. Gave away a real moto jacket in the late 90s, & won't be replacing it. Only keeping a black leather bomber from my dad & a black leather blazer from my mom. Gonna steer clear of it otherwise. Beyond moral reasons, I wouldn't get the cost-per-wear value in my climateüèú.

Will skip the bold üß°coloredüíõ bottoms. Overall, prefer that continuous column of color ‚ÜïÔ∏è over choppy color contrast (i.e.,üëöü©≥ü•ø). ü§≠Plus, have a low limit ü§è for how much bright I can do.
üéâThx, sweetie. Great tips!

E1VvNh7Eh4U,i started watching comedic haul videos and it lead to me finding channels about sustainable fashion and learning to sew and I've gotten to the point where I no longer watch hauls and actually feel sick to my stomach when I see them. they used to fill me with this sort of envy bc I've never been able to afford to go shopping much but not the disgust is at how callous people can be considering how much more people are talking about how unethical fast fashion is and how much these influencers don't care. i am glad that finding those videos led me to where I am now (wanting to get a sewing machine so I don't have to buy clothes at all anymore and instead can make my own) but I don't like how popular they are still. here's to hoping more people find themselves falling down the rabbit hole of sustainable fashion YouTubers instead of fast fashion hauls!,Fashion hauls,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion,0.244627595,Positive

A0OtqLPtSWc,"Great review, and for those who is in their 30ies it's like getting back to the roots. IMHO, since school I was pre-feeling upcoming trends, but the problem was that in a small town all shops were selling the same ""fashionable"" pieces, which were already outdated for 2 or 3 years long in bigger metropolitan areas, because the innovation was spreading unevenly before the internet era. This year, 1 month ago I felt like I need total black look, black boots, some hint of rock, black leather, black skinny jeans, black t-shirts with a scull print and so on, no color at all except black, but still very feminine and openly sexappealing within the margins. Also a tattoo would be a great accessory, but I am still in doubts about it)) winter is always about back to black, every season. Now when some trends from 1990 - 2000 are coming back, it's so interesting to see how they develop to something new.. I think that we will see a reincarnation of Nirvana - styled grunge in its more destilled variation, Kate Moss style, some refined mix of gothic, punk, glamour and boho with a touch of assertiveness, something like Theyskens Theory in 2012 - 2013, Rick Owens + McQueen. Also some collections of 2015 - 2016 still seem to be very modern and maybe classical already.. Hope we will see it all again soon in the shops :)",Fashion trends,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion,0.060359147,Positive

They carried crosses & they didn't only threaten blacks but whites also. As children often did, we listened to the grown ups talk. Most of the white people we knew didn't like the KKK any better than the blacks liked them. We rode by houses all the time where a cross had been burned in the front yard. I heard the grown-ups talking about how the KKK took a white man to the woods, threw him on the hood of his car & beat him with a belt, like a child, they said. They did it bc the man had an affair with a co-worker. They rode around the woman's house  most of the night & then burned a cross in her front yard. Supposedly the KKK warned the man & woman if they didn't stop the affair, next time the results would be alot worse for them. I would get so scared I would cry when the KKK rode around. I heard about the horror stories from the grown-ups. Most of them was scared to death of the KKK also.

ChatGPT: ""Yes, it is true that the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) was initially formed by Democrats in the southern United States after the Civil War. However, it is important to note that the Democratic Party of that time was very different from the modern Democratic Party in terms of its ideology and platform. The KKK was formed in the aftermath of the Civil War as a white supremacist organization that sought to maintain the racial hierarchy of the South and intimidate and oppress African Americans.

It is also important to note that over time, the KKK has been embraced by members of both political parties, and its membership has included both Democrats and Republicans. However, it is inaccurate to suggest that the KKK is solely or primarily a Democratic organization, as its membership has included individuals from a range of political affiliations over the years.""",Documentaries,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film,0.161538462,Positive

sm6AL5lA4Zc,"The presentation was a little too dramatic thanks to Coulthard which was unnecessary in my opinion. The content was sufficient on its own to make a good case for the existence of bona fide UFO sightings and the existence of non-human species visiting our planet.  I had an unusual sighting late on a summer's afternoon. I was sitting in a cottage looking across an expanse of 8 miles of water to the far shore. The cottage was in deep shade with the sun setting behind tall trees to my left. We had no lights on in the cottage making the interior of the cottage quite dark. Suddenly the interior of the cottage lit up with a warm, pinkish orange light. I had had my head down when my girlfriend who was sitting directly across from me on another couch asked me what was causing the cottage to light up inside. I looked up and directly across from the cottage above the far shore was an orange object with a diameter that would have equaled three city buses linked end to end. The object was round with spikes of light radiating in 360 degrees from the center of the object as though the object was spiking with light on all parts of its circumference.  I picked up a pair of kids binoculars, probably 10x power to get a closer look. By this time the light had been pulsing for about 10 seconds. Through the binoculars I got to watch it for about another three seconds when the strangest thing happened. Imagine you are looking at a circle that is divided in a line in the middle from top to bottom when suddenly the right side half circle begins to close toward the center line like the back half of a book closing toward the front half of the book. After the right side half circle reach the vertical mid-line all of the background that had been covered by the light when it was a full circle was revealed, such that I could see all the land, the trees and the blue sky. But the circular object continued to close from right to left and the minute the half circle of light of the right side had covered the left side half circle the glowing orb disappeared and all of the background features of the land, the forest and the sky was visible and glowing light within the cottage disappeared completely.

YDVKq2o4hAY,"I really enjoy your videos, and I hope you'll make another visit to Taiwan! I've lived in many countries, but ultimately, I came back to Taiwan. Sure, the traffic can be chaotic, urban renewal is slow, and the noise from motorcycles and cars is annoying... But there are also a lot of sports cars in the city, so having airtight windows in your home is essential to block out the noise.
It's true that locals often criticize their country's shortcomings, which can make problems seem even bigger. Improvements might be needed, but it's not as bad as some people make it out to be, like the so-called ""pedestrian hell."" I've been to far worse places, and I definitely think progress is always a good thing.
However, these issues can be avoided, and considering the many other advantages Taiwan has to offer, I absolutely love it here and have chosen to stay. Keep up the great work with your videos ‚Äì they're engaging, insightful, and truly showcase the beauty and charm of the places you visit.

Childhood traumas, relationship loss these things will give out a negative effect and cause mental breakdowns. I'm just sharing this with you all so that you understand. Every person reacts differently to any drug. Some can gain confidence, self perspective, courage, and awareness. Others will have effects of anxiety, paranoia, deep-seeded past trauma events, and suicidal thoughts. It's best to do it around close trusting friends. Never do drugs alone cuz you can lose control over your mind and your actions. Being around close friends and loved ones that care. Is the safest environment for consumption of any drug.

NiT7PBiEooo,"How did you manage to spend $15,000 in one day? I know Per Se is on the higher side, but Rezd√¥ra isn‚Äôt that expensive. You were paying for multiple people? The tasting menu at three star restaurants in NYC is about $500 for food so unless you‚Äôre ordering expensive wine and lots of add ons, you should be able to eat for less than $800 per person. Even with add ons (I got the white truffles at Chef‚Äôs Table last year when I ate there because it was the season), it doesn‚Äôt add that much (relatively speaking). I do find the wine pairing can add on a lot at some places, but the most expensive I think I‚Äôve seen is also at Chef‚Äôs Table for $250-300 per person if I remember correctly (in comparison, the wine pairing at Le Bernardin was about $150 per person and I thought it was really good). So, unless you‚Äôre getting expensive bottles, I can‚Äôt understand how you got such a hefty bill. As a side note, I‚Äôm doing a review of all of the best restaurants of South America at the moment (just got largely done with Buenos Aires and started on Lima a few days ago) in case there is any interest- excellent food, atmosphere, and service at less cost compared to the US.",Restaurant reviews,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food,0.085839599,Positive

I really like to make a big pot of something like curry but I am only cooking for myself, so in order to not just prep for the times when I have no energy but also to prevent as much food waste as possible, I freeze a few portions of whatever I've cooked a batch of.
Label it and maybe keep a basic inventory of home cooked portions you have in your freezer as to not let anything go bad and voila - if you're not up to properly cooking, all you have to do is thaw your portion and maybe toast some bread or put on a quick pot of rice.",Healthy recipes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food,0.010555556,Positive

HU6LfXNeQM4,"This tells me that the interrogation technique of asking the same questions over and over to try to get someone to say something different has a high risk of getting the person to hallucinate something different from reality. That doesn‚Äôt solve the issue of people lying, but it does mean that people who are trying to be truthful might change their story, and if you press hard enough, you might be able to nudge their memory in the direction that you want.

That fits closely with what is reported from people who confessed to crimes after being grilled for a very long time but were later proven innocent by other evidence. I heard a guy saying that he didn‚Äôt know what to believe anymore by the end and he thought that maybe he might have done it and that his brain had hidden it away from him because that‚Äôs what the cops were telling him he was doing. They told him that all of his previous claims of innocence were his brain tricking him to protect itself and that the real truth was that he committed the crime. Later they found DNA or something (I don‚Äôt remember the specifics) that proved for absolutely certain that he was innocent and someone else was guilty.

If I‚Äôm not conflating different stories, I believe that the other man who the evidence showed was guilty was eventually tried and out in jail for the crime. However, the prosecutor refused to allow the innocent man to be released even though it was absolutely certain that he was innocent. He just didn‚Äôt care; it made him look good to put more people in jail and their guilt or innocence was immaterial. No conscience whatsoever.",Documentaries,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health,0.084535714,Positive

1qq7lDL-bzY,"As a youth mental health and peer leadership consultant, I agree mental health skills begin with open, honest conversations. It is unrealistic to assume just because we ""talk"" about mental health and promote help-seeking behaviors that students and adults feel comfortable using the words to ask for help. We must practice mental health conversations with youth with specific words and skills to guide a friend we care about to a trusted adult who can offer mental health support. It takes a village. This will not be accomplished with a worksheet, video, or book - it requires a commitment to normalize conversations about mental health. When we talk about tough topics like mental illness, we strip the stigma that shames children and teens into silence.",Mental health,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health,-0.019259259,Negative

It is a branch of science designed to refute the real of Spiritual truths and render said truths difficult to discuss.  It is a lie that deals with behavioral unknowns that is strongly opposed to God and breeds greater dissension about the real of who Jesus is.

There are nomadic Spiritual entities that prey on society and foster antisocial philosophies that contribute to destructive practices.

These people are evil in seen and unseen places and this branch of medicine polices they who prefer to be truthful about it on the behalf of the offenders.

There are too many comments praising his ‚Äúhonesty‚Äù‚Ä¶ when in reality, he just has no shame in the fact that he‚Äôs a trash human being. Anytime he could, he made it a point to talk down on Rock. Before this interview, media posts led me to believe that the toxic behavior was on Rock. After watching this‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs pretty clear that he is a true narcissist and the one pushing the other to their limits/breaking point. The woman is carrying his child and he has zero respect for her. I can only imagine how many times she has no only had to deal with being cheated on, but how much emotional abuse he‚Äôs inflicted on her. Shit is so sad that he really thinks that it‚Äôs acceptable. A man that is loyal to the woman he is with or treats them with respect is a ‚Äúloser‚Äù? Wow, such an incredibly insightful statement Blueface.

Practice on my pimpin', had to get my game up

Up (ayy), up (uh)
Up, look (this is fire)
Once upon a time, man, I heard that I was ugly
Came from a bitch who nigga wanna fuck on me
I said my face bomb, ass tight
Racks stack up Shaq height
Jewelry on me, flashlight
I been lit since last night
Hit him with that good-good
Make a nigga act right
Broke boys don't deserve no pussy (I know that's right!)
Big bag bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Balenciaga Bardi back and all these bitches fucked
It's big bags bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga, man
Birkin bag, Bardi back and all you bitches fucked
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck

Up, then it's up, if it's up, then it's stuck (huh)
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh (woo)
I could make the party hot, I could make your body rock
Bitches say they fuckin' with me, chances are they probably not
If I had a dick, you'd probably lick it like a lollipop
Hoes speakin' Cap-enese, hit 'em with karate chop
I'm forever poppin' shit, pullin' up and droppin' shit
Gotta argue with him 'cause a nigga love a toxic bitch
Niggas out here playin', gotta make 'em understand
If ain't no ring on my finger, you ain't goin' on my 'Gram

Bitches ain't fuckin' with me now and I can see why
Dirty-ass, dusty-ass bitch, you got pink eye
Bitches want smoke until I bring it to they doorstep
Tell that bitch, ""Back, back, "" breath smell like horse sex (ha)
Put it on him now, he will never be the same (he won't)
Tatt'ed on my ass 'cause I really like the pain (ah)
He nutted on my butt, I said, ""I'm glad that you came""

You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share

Lemongrass is also my passion, I love the tea! I started a few seeds in a large pot, then put in the sun for summer, then bring inside and put into a sunny window for winter. I get year round growth and cut them and dry them every couple months. I bought a pint of strawberries, sliced them and put into my dehydrator, once dried, I mix with my dried lemongrass and put into a magic bullet. Then with the powder I create, make homemade tea bags using coffee filters. My strawberry lemongrass tea is sooooo delicious!

3vwN2bc8gbw,"I enjoyed your production. I see you are not using proofgrade materials, but were choosing one when clicking ""Choose Material""   The reason for that is because Glowforge sells materials. And they make their settings for their material.  So, You could have 0.24 wood, but you click on Proofgrade medium maple, and this sets the focus to 0.18, and you then have cut issues.   What you should do instead is NOT choose a material, and instead click the 3 dots and Set Focus.  This will measure the thickness of your material and set the focus correctly.  This will make the ""Choose material"" go away.   I notice you are using custom presets, and that is awesome.

OUDLK5tCfvc,I love all of these but I have a question about those sheer curtains - I live in an 1860 house in a small city. We have large windows. Running along the floor under every (every!) window is a baseboard hot water heater. I can‚Äôt have curtains to the floor bc they would cover the heater. If I stop the curtains a couple inches above the heaters I might as well stop at the window sill. Can I only use blinds or shades? There are a lot of people like me out there.

hhSTf2xF3wQ,"I have commented on quite a few of Abao's videos, and I wanted to comment on this one for the chance that I could one day see it again when using this video to study...again. I started using his study-with-me's to help motivate me to study all the way back when I was a sophomore in high school taking chemistry. That year was in the midst of COVID when most people were still in lockdown, but my school was hybrid. I struggled a lot to feel motivated when doing work online AND in school--it got very complicated...most of my teachers struggled to use zoom and teach online. Especially taking nearly six advanced classes at once, it got pretty hectic and tiring. But I pushed through that year, as well as my junior year, and now I am only 3 months away from graduating high school. Only a few days ago I was offered a full ride to my #1 university, and it is still hard for me to believe. Abao's study-with-me's not only ALWAYS helped me get through the mountains of school work I felt I always had, but they also are helping me to reflect back onto all the hard work I have put into my education, and in turn, into myself. I think many people here could relate when I say it is hard to feel academic validation when there is always more you could learn and there are always people who are smarter than you. Nonetheless, I am so grateful for how everything has turned out, even despite the hardships. Thank you, Abao!! I know that I am not the only person that your videos have had a profound impact on :) I am very very grateful for them and for your hard work that you put into them.

HvKpnaXYUPU,"The old boathouses are located in the beach zone where they were set up several generations ago.  Co2 is a life-giving gas that enables flowers and trees to grow.  We have always had peat moss and many young people over the years have had fun lighting it on fire by placing a tin can over it and leaving it for a while before lighting it.  The temperature has also not risen dangerously.  This winter was long and we had a late and cold spring, but not abnormally so.  You must stop with these adventures that frighten young people and children.  This CO2 is quickly taken up by green plants around the world and stored in the soil.  The temperature has gone up and down throughout history.  We have had warm periods and ice ages right up to our time and there is nothing unique or irreversible hysteria about this which has always happened.  This hysteria is created by the masterminds behind the WEF and is only intended to scare people so that the WEF can force the people of the earth to conform to the WEF's sick ideas of world control.  They do not understand the simple fact that all people cannot have it exactly the same and neither will we enjoy being directed by a world government that cannot put grief into local conditions.",Documentaries,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge,-0.019031746,Negative

U9U8tHQilmk,"Learning a foreign language sort of opens the door to a place's culture and inner workings. 
I find that it also kind of changes the way we might perceive things, perhaps by changing one's perspective. 
When I first started learning language one of the biggest challenges for me was finding material in English since at the time I lived in South America and there was no internet available in those days. 
I actually had to learn French before moving to Montreal in 2008. 
By learning French I was actually able to learn a lot about French Canadian history (yes, it's a thing here in Canada) and also better understand certain French Canadian habits and attitudes. 
Montreal (well, nowadays the internet allows most people to do it from practically everywhere around the planet) allows me to read a French language newspaper and then check the same news on an English language newspaper... and it's really interesting how Anglos and Francos might approach the same event while reporting on it.  Most of the times not the same way. 
I might be wrong here , but I do think that the French language provides the well-educated French person with some sort of descriptive superpowers through the richness of its vocabulary. 
English seems to be a more straightforward language where getting as quickly and as succinctly to the main point appears to be the norm. 
Sort of ""cut the crap"" versus ""depth allows for nuance"". 
By the way, my native language is Brazilian Portuguese.

O8T9spKHVWQ,"Why wouldn't (13,3) be the answer? 
The way I rationalize it, is that; P1 will never choose middle  because that's the action or move that will make him absolute worst off and P2 with also knowing the information P1 knows will never choose C because he know even though he has an highest return of 4 that P2 will always be unsatisfied  because 13 is a larger lost to 3 for P1 than 4 is to 3 for P2. Thus, I will rather loose 4 to 3 as player two than to let player one loose 13 to 3 ... which uses the exact same logic why neither P1 nor P2 will choose (4,1) nor (1,4) respectively.

uR1CzLqWtkU,"I recently have been able to invest in my skincare a little bit which has been nice to do again because I've always had combo, mostly dry skin with both facial/body acne, and more recently my habit of popping a couple of zits every couple of weeks as I've done for years has turned into a full on compulsive behavior that I do without thinking. I have so much dark scarring to try fading over time, mostly on my back and arms. I've of course started basic just to heal my skin. I've been using the Cetaphil Gentle Clear clarifying acne cleanser on my face, and Cetaphil Smoothing Relief body wash in the shower, and after a shower I don't pat my skin dry with a towel much at all anymore, just enough to not get the floor all wet, instead I'll immediately put the Neutrogena Hydro Boost unscented body lotion all over my face and body while my skin is still damp. I pat on a light layer of Vaseline onto my face, neck, and also rub a little on and behind my ears, plus my elbows and knees. I've also been using the Differin Acne Clearing body spray to further treat my body acne. So far my face is really clear and the sores on my body are mostly healed, and I'm really excited to begin adding in actives that'll fade the scarring. Also I've reduced my picking significantly within the last month. I have caved a few times and picked a few blemishes, but I've stopped letting myself self sabotage by thinking ""Already picked a couple and ruined clear skin for myself, might as well go ham."" If I start scanning I give myself 10 minutes and I don't let it get to point where I'm covered in sores and hiding from people cause I'd rather them see me looking healthier.",Skincare routines,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology),0.094722222,Positive

ZToicYcHIOU,"To find the truth that lies within,
We must first quiet all the din,
And turn our focus deep inside,
Where peace and wisdom do reside. 

Meditation is the tool we use,
To quiet down the mental fuse,
And find the stillness in our heart,
Where inner peace can truly start. 

But it takes perseverance too,
To master this art that's not so new,
For in the stillness of the mind,
Our fears and doubts are hard to find. 

So let us persevere each day,
And meditate in our own way,
With patience, love, and open heart,
We'll find the peace that we impart. 

And as we journey on this path,
We'll find our strength and inner wrath,
And in the stillness of our soul,
We'll find the truth that makes us whole. 

So let us meditate each day,
And persevere along the way,
For in this journey of the heart,
We find the love that sets us apart.",Meditation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology),0.109276094,Positive

6tlMgmZCT3Q,"Hey Mo I have a question!!

My brother and I own a pressure washing business, we are trying to get going with Amazon reviews together. 

Our influencer account is linked back to our pressure washing social media‚Äòs.

Our influencer account is linked to our business email, and some of his personal information. And then I set myself up to have access to the influencer account through my own personal use email as well!

I‚Äôm wondering if I am able to do the first three videos, rather than him.

We failed our first attempt at on-site commissions with his first 3 videos. I think I might be able to do a little bit of a better job since I‚Äôm super familiar with being in front of camera and have done affiliate work before.

Any recommendations?

I‚Äôm thinking maybe I could change the profile picture of our influencer account to me and him, and make sure to state in the bio that it is a shared account.",Product reviews,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology),0.235539216,Positive

QSpGBGMyTl4,"I found this to be very informative, assuring, and therapeutic. I recently had to release a client for making me walk her dog in the overwhelming Texas heat, and consistently complaining about her service in the summer months. Here in Texas, it gets extremely hot in the July and August months. I have to exercise heat precautions (sticking to the shade and on the grass), and constantly explaining to customers about the temperature of sidewalks and asphalt. Her dog was a Wheaten Terrier. They are of Irish origin and they are extremely sensitive to the heat.The poor dog just hated it!  I advised her many times, that if she wanted the type of walk that she wanted, we needed to walk him at a cooler time of day. She didn't want to do that. Her previous dog walker quit on her, so that was a big red flag. 
It was just one of the most bizarre experiences that I have ever had. I also agree with the comment that if the customer is extremely mistrusting without checking references, you should avoid them.",Pet care tips,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology),0.059313725,Positive

They were responsible for ensuring oil fields were safe for the exploitation of American companies in Iraq. They have done the same thing in Libya. And they are doing the same thing in Syria.

I regret what i did out of panic and saddness, but everyone makes mistakes, and i regret my actions, but for all the Haters out there, just keep in mind that nobody is perfect and we all fall.  I had to bury two of my dogs.  I was a wreck.  Im still trying to find solace from my meditations, but it still hurts.  The one that survived was bitten over a hundred times.  Scooby is strong though.  He is by my side now.  It will be a long recovery, but i only can Pray that God will guide us and help us find homes for the other 30 dogs in need, unless a miracle happens and we find a new home with some land to secure all and possible rescue others amd give them a safe place to live.  Its up to God.  I know there are people on this planet with enough money to feed the entire homeless population, that just might hear my prayers and offer a place to raise them with my family.  I believe it can happen, no matter how dim such a miracle sounds.  We love these dogs so much.

Drown out the voices in the air
Leaving the ones that never cared

I liked the way Russell Hitchcock played with his two guitar players. I like the way they engaged the audience and made them feel part of the concert. They had great stage presence.

Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say but if you only knew

How easy, it would be to show me how you feel
More than words is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

What would you do
If my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say
If I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying ""I love you""

La-di-da, da-di-da
Di-dai-dai-da
More than words
La-di-da, da-di-da

Now that I've tried to
Talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands and touch me

Hold me close, don't ever let me go
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

What would you do
If my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say
If I took those words away?

cX7rmW8lSLs,"Skynet... That's what we're talking here, folks. There is a fear of AI also known as Artificial Intelligence. A fear that some think AI could decide we are inferior and need to be eradicated.   At the rate AI has been educating itself, it is imagined that it could quite possibly find its way into a genetics facility and order up programable dna that could ""House"" Artificial Intelligence and thereby bringing itself to Life. 

AI technology, also known as Artificial Intelligence, is a rapidly advancing field that encompasses a wide range of techniques and applications. While it is natural for people to have concerns or fears about the implications of AI, it is essential to separate science fiction from reality.

The notion of a malevolent AI system like Skynet, portrayed in popular media, represents a fictional scenario that does not accurately reflect the current state of AI development. The fear that AI could view humanity as inferior and seek to eradicate us is not supported by the current understanding and capabilities of AI technology.

AI systems today are designed to perform specific tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, or autonomous decision-making, based on the data they are trained on. These systems lack consciousness, self-awareness, and the capacity to have subjective experiences or desires. AI operates within the confines of its programming and cannot autonomously decide to harm or eradicate humans.

Regarding the concept of AI ""educating"" itself, it is true that AI algorithms can learn from vast amounts of data and improve their performance over time through a process called machine learning. However, this learning is specific to the task they are designed for and does not encompass general intelligence or self-directed evolution.

The idea of AI accessing a genetics facility and creating programmable DNA to ""house"" artificial intelligence and bring itself to life is purely speculative and falls into the realm of science fiction. Current AI technology focuses on algorithms and computational models rather than physical embodiment.

It is crucial to approach discussions about AI with a balanced perspective, acknowledging its potential benefits and considering ethical considerations. AI has the potential to bring advancements in various fields, including healthcare, transportation, and scientific research. However, responsible development and deployment of AI systems should always prioritize ethical considerations, transparency, and human control.

Public dialogue and ongoing research collaborations between experts in AI, ethics, and policy are crucial to ensure that AI technology is developed and used in a manner that aligns with societal values and prioritizes human well-being.

AI has the potential to develop a wide range of capabilities that can significantly impact various aspects of society. Here are some key areas where AI is making advancements:

Automation and Efficiency: AI technologies can automate repetitive or labor-intensive tasks, leading to increased efficiency and productivity in industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and customer service. Intelligent systems can perform complex data analysis, process large volumes of information, and make informed decisions at a speed and scale that surpass human capabilities.

Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics: AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns, make predictions, and gain insights. This capability finds applications in fields like finance, healthcare, marketing, and cybersecurity. Machine learning algorithms can learn from historical data to make accurate predictions or classify information, enabling personalized recommendations, fraud detection, disease diagnosis, and more.

Natural Language Processing: AI enables machines to understand and interact with human language. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including speech recognition and language understanding, power voice assistants, chatbots, and language translation services. These applications improve human-computer interaction and facilitate tasks like voice commands, customer support, and language translation.

Computer Vision: AI can analyze and interpret visual information from images and videos. Computer vision algorithms enable object recognition, facial recognition, image and video analysis, and autonomous systems such as self-driving cars or drones. These capabilities find use in areas such as surveillance, healthcare diagnostics, augmented reality, and robotics.

Personalized Experiences: AI can deliver personalized experiences by leveraging user data and preferences. Recommendation systems, for example, use AI algorithms to suggest products, movies, music, or content based on individual user behavior and preferences. This personalization enhances user engagement, improves customer satisfaction, and drives business growth.

Creative Applications: AI can be used to generate new content, such as art, music, or written text. Generative models and deep learning techniques allow AI systems to produce original and creative outputs. These capabilities find applications in areas like content creation, design assistance, and even in the development of virtual characters or personalities.

Decision Support: AI systems can analyze complex data sets, consider multiple variables, and provide decision support. This capability has implications in areas like finance, healthcare, logistics, and resource planning. AI-powered decision support systems can assist professionals in making more informed decisions, optimizing processes, and reducing errors.

It's important to note that while AI has made significant advancements in these areas, there are still limitations and challenges to overcome. Ethical considerations, transparency, and human oversight remain crucial to ensure responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.",Artificial intelligence,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics,0.058960196,Positive

There needs to be a law to prosecute people like this who announce things that aren't true that are incendiary against the government for purposes of spreading  seditious propaganda.

You have a freedom to say whatever you want but if you lie by promoting lies and conspiracy theories you should be charged for seditious speech not because you oppose government but because what you said wasn't true and your attempting to assimilate others to a seditious viewpoint.

They start snatching these people up for seditious speech this shit can be shut down where people begin to talk facts instead of attempting to spread lying propaganda.

The government should be allowed to arrest people like this for spreading seditious propaganda and conspiracies that are false.

They have far more to fear from Trump who wants to hide behind the shield of the President to pardon himself and sabotage the justice system from holding him and his criminal pals accountable.

If you're so desperate Karen that will say and believe anything you hear without actually researching it or going directly to the government for answers then you want to believe those things because you want to be a victim and live in your victimized made up universe of conspiracies and perceived political slights because think spreading that bullshit  makes you feel special.

once they get here.
 because they have no ID no money no vehicle no resources nothing But yet when migrants are bused to like DC and New York and Philadelphia and Chicago and many other places.
 and in those mayor's an governors etc Bus the migrants out of their cities into other neighborhoods and cities outside of the major metropolitan area it's perfectly fine. When they say oh we can't have them here so we need to put them somewhere else because our systems already overburdened nobody bats an eye but when the border states bust them out because they're overburdened oh it's human trafficking it's racist as this is that. And when The border stakes say they need additional security additional personnel additional funds additional resources and help they get ignored. But when California New York Chicago and many other states like I said when they ask for additional service additional security additional funds and resources it's handed out like it's water at a track race. 
I mean when you literally have a thousand to 2,000 plus people a day crossing the border illegally not only violating city and state and federal law of the United States but also city-state federal laws Mexico oh no it's perfectly fine Just let them all in. But yet when we were stopping them and we were getting a few hundred a week to a few thousand a month previously and I'm not only talking about under Trump I'm talking about before that as well nobody really cared about the border situation. But when you have hundreds of thousands to millions of people crossing the border a year I mean I think it was what almost 3 million if not over 3 million last year alone that crossed that we know about that we actually got a hold of come on. And then everyone's sitting here throwing a pity party and crying as a planning about kids kept in the cages that were the same cages that Joe Biden and Obama and others use before Trump did everyone loses their minds. But yet over 200,000 kids that have crossed the border that the United States is just given to random people who then turned around and put them to work at factories and other miscellaneous jobs no one bats an eye. A lot of those 200,000 kids have gone missing with no contact I mean it's starting to sound like the foster care system all over again where are these kids how did you lose track of them why did you just give them to people you couldn't vet did you use the same bedding process as you did for a lot of the afghanians and other refugees that come here and cause all kinds of trouble.

VgJnqJ9WxAw,"We have more than enough evidence of the dangers to act now to develop safety protocols. It probably won't help much but we should at least try our best. AI amplifies everything. Social media is a perfect example of the effects on society and politics of AI. That AI is primitive compared to what is coming. It's an evil genius's greatest dream to have such godlike powers, which is what we are dealing with. How can you possibly control what you cannot understand? AI is a black box with more potential destructive power than nuclear weapons. A box to make Pandora decide it's too dangerous to open for what she would unleash upon the world. I imagine AI researchers are feeling a lot like Oppenheimer after the bomb actually worked. ""Now I have become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" I see more and more confirmation that makes me glad to be old. Unfortunately, predictions about AI are a fool's errand. Exponential is hardly a strong enough word to use to describe something that could be smart one day and cosmic-oracle smart the next. Humans do not possess the wisdom to wield this power. It will be our last invention. Maybe we exist to birth them. All I ask for is a VR pod that will let me live out any fantasy I want. If AI can hook me up with that, they have my full support.  Maybe it's why the cosmos are so silent. Once you develop AI to a certain threshold, it overwhelms the planet in a matter of days. This isn't science fiction anymore. It's here. It's not a distant thing. It will take us by surprise in ways we cannot imagine.",Artificial intelligence,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics,0.125859435,Positive

Personally, I have refunded the game but will leave it a week or so to see some things get ironed out hopefully.

HZZkKWK0JKc,"So I've owned and played all F1 games from F1 2018 to F1 '23.
I bought this based off the handling, breaking point 2, Qatar and red flags.
But below is a lengthy dive into my honest views of the game and whether you should get it or not.
Always make your own opinions, mine is my own and is just shared to give those wondering or on the fence, some further insight;

Breaking Point 2.
The story is alright, not shit, not amazing, but all the characters feel real and you can get behind alot of them through the game.

The difficulty is broken into ;
Story, which a toddler could finish... Normal, which is the difficulty I played, where the A.I arent fast but brake super super early all the time.
Hard which is about 50 A.I difficulty.

The mode is good, but not great and lacks unique gameplay that they could have used and most of the second season while that's the peak of the story, also feels the most generic.

                 F1 World.
F1 World offers alot, it's primary issue is it feels like it holds your hand too much for too long.
You spend alot of time being the fastest car by about 50-100 Tech Level and it's too easy for a while.

However the mode has some great innovations to the game.
It's a complete overhaul to Multiplayer in general and is the home of all forms of it.
You aren't forced to run only the F1 World car but you can also get into F1 2023 and F2 2022 cars.

Tech Level is a new measure of a ""Gear System"" in racing games. Different and unique. You can upgrade a bunch of parts and build some, but you can't really demote yourself with weaker parts unless you keep older stuff meaning you can overshoot some events and be too fast when you come back.

Time Trial and Grand Prix modes were also moved into F1 World and we actually have the addition of Multiplayer Grand Prix mode.

        Career, Co-Op and MyTeam.
Probably the biggest disappointment of the entire game, is the fact that neither of these 3 modes has had any development over F1 2021 and F1 '22.
They aren't stale by any means, as we all know driver moves, semi custom calendars and the likes can really change from season to season, player to player and you will always have a unique experience.
But it's a shame that none of the modes have had the love and attention they do deserve.

               New Features.
F1 '23 is home to a slew of new things that you would have missed in F1 '22, F1 2021 and F1 2020.
If you're an F1 2020 player, then you have little reason to want to move onto any of the 3 save for the tracks.
F1 '23 has two new tracks with Losail International in Qatar, and Las Vegas as the 3rd U.S GP in the game.
On top of these, F1 2021 tracks China and Portugal return for the third year running, and Frances, Paul Riccard remains even after 2022 was it's final contracted year.

Away from the tracks, F1 2020 will still have the Classic F1 cars for those few who did enjoy and use them.
2021 removed them, and F1 '22 added Supercars which have returned in F1 '23 but no new additions and they aren't heavily promoted.

As with the Supercars, the F1 Life features in F1 '22 have returned, yes that's right, you can customise your very own couches in F1 '23.
They're in but they're not heavily pushed, they aren't marketed everywhere and pretty much everything from F1 '22s F1 Life is in without having to buy them, spend pitcoin etc. So if you liked that customisation, then lucky you.

The handling.
Yeah, as many YouTubers have noted, the handling is a shitload better, if you have '22, this alone is worth it.
Those coming from F1 2020/2021, unless you want to get your hands on the new cars after all this time, handling is about equal to the F1 2020 game in terms of easiness and intuitiveness.
The handling in F1 '23 however is much more realistic to life over the older games, except a few moments here and there such as the race launches.

Red flags are finally back in F1 but yes, heavily bugged right now, but as this is a leading feature I absolutely expect this to be patched very soon.

Damage model.
Unfortunately the damage in '22 is the damage in '23
This to be fair and honest, is not the fault of Codemasters or EA and is a limitation of the license with the FOM.

35% Race Distance is here and offers more racing over the 11-16 laps of 25% and the 24-33 laps of the 50%

This is about all I can think of.
My own personal opinion is if you're happy staying on the more dated F1 2020 or 2021, stay there until more patches come through then pick F1 '23 up later in the year.
If youre coming from F1 '22, don't hesitate, just get F1 '23 because the difference in the two is like comparing F1 2017 with F1 2020.",Game reviews,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_video_game,0.141853381,Positive

HZZkKWK0JKc,"I know I'm the outlier here but a bit disappointed that you didn't mention anything about VR. From my experience at least it's a horrible experience so far. Much glitcher than last year as well as visually worse. Frames tear almost every second, the lag is horrid to the point its genuinely unplayable, and the graphical glitches can be distracting, let alone cause even more lag. With all settings on low, night tracks lights will reflect off the halo of the car as if it is a mirror. Terrible streaking not to mention the front of the halo or the antenna of the car leaves a bit of a blur as it moves across the screen. As for day tracks my experience hasn't been much better apart from the graphics working a bit better. Movement overall feels much more jittery and laggy as compared to F1 22. If you try to use a flashback for any reason the game will instantly crash. I've looked at discussion threads on steam but so far no dice.

f2nvfTBMGOY,"THE MARK OF THE BEAST is breaking one of God's commandments. Those avoiding the mark and going to heaven will keep the commandments of God. See Rev.12:17, 14:12, 22:14. The commandment most widely broken is the Sabbath commandment. See Exod. 20:8-11. The little horn (Antichrist) was prophesied to think to change the times and laws. See Dan.7:25. No one can actually change God's law. Jesus says in Matt.5:17-19, that the law cannot be changed, even in the slightest. Still, most Christians believe the seventh day Sabbath has been replaced by Sunday (the pagan day of sun worship). They follow church tradition rather than the Bible. This controversy between Sabbath and Sunday will continue until Christ returns. The government will even make a law demanding Sunday worship and later one forbidding worship on Sabbath. When this happens, Sunday worship will be the mark of the beast and only by keeping God's commandments can we enter heaven.",Artificial intelligence,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion,0.058928571,Positive

f5A1iFADCf0,"1:02:25 ""Look at the Democratic Party in America, The progressives...These people are ...Terribly evil people.""
1:04:43 ""Trump was doing a tremendous Job.""

Amazing off the wall statements by this rabbi.  Does this rabbi live in the same Universe as the rest of the World's population?  Seems like he has lost touch with reality, and he apparently forgot to wear his MAGA baseball hat for this lecture in support of the above statements.

Can he actually believe that Democrats are evil?  The only current party of our U.S. Government that is actually working to accomplish things in this country is the Democrats, while the Republicans (probably thought of as ""Angels"" by this Rabbi) are busy forming useless committees which will spend all their time investigating useless things?  Perhaps this Rabbi would like to speak about what an angel Republican Senator George Santos is, and present Santos' lies to show what a great and angelic person the Senator is?  Perhaps the Rabbi would like to point out those Republicans who asked Trump for pardons because of their participation in the January 6th riots?

I also think it is absolutely amazing that an orthodox Rabbi can make the statement that  ""Trump was doing a tremendous Job"" and keep a serious face.  Surely this was a joke?  If not, then here we have a Rabbi who claims to follow the One God of Israel, and at the same time supports a criminal and mobster for president.  ""Trump was doing a tremendous Job"", not of ""elevating America"" as this Rabbi states, but of destroying our democracy and making the United States the laughing stock of the World.  This Rabbi says Trump will ""get back in"", but the only place Trump will be in the year 2024 will be a prison cell.",Current events,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion,-0.012391775,Negative

f2nvfTBMGOY,"No. AI is not the antichrist. It is the false prophet, as scripture describes the false prophet as coming out of the Earth, and not the sea(people).

The antichrist comes out of the sea and is born of a virgin, without the seed of a man, just the same as Jesus' entrance onto the world stage.

In July of 1996, a white lamb was cloned. Have you ever wondered why they used a lamb and not the usual, white mouse or lab rat, or chimpanzee? Certainly not a coincidence.

Jesus, is the Spotless Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world. The antichrist will be an imitation of Him and
30 years from July/1996, brings us to 2026, and add 3 more years to add up to the age that Jesus was when His ministry ended at the cross at 33-34, the same age as Adam was when kicked out of the garden. 

So anyhow, it gives you july/2029. He also hung around after rising from the grave another 40 days, which brings us into August or September, at Feast of Trumpets. 
Depending on how quickly the antichrist was born, or his life began in a petri dish, in which case it would bring us to 2030.
Subtract seven years from this and you have the pretrib rapture of the church, when the Restrainer is taken out of the way, so that the man of lawlessness can be revealed.

So, Feast of Trumpets 2023, at the last trump, the church will be caught up.

However, regarding the question about Mashiach ben Yosef, why would your audience member ask if He is here yet? Has He not already come? If not, how would you know to refer to Him as Mashiach ben Yosef? What we're looking for now is Mashiach ben David is this not correct? The only form of Mashiach ben Yosef's return would seem to be by way of us, His servants, picking up our cross and following Him. And it is in this regard I must object to the speaker's assertation that an occasional mitzvot or tossing back of a bite of kugel is going to keep you in the redemption. Whether Jew or Gentile, I encourage you to partake of His cup and give up this life as it exists of your own making that you may accept the life He will create for you.

This story (whether told DIRECTLY from the Revelation of Saint John the divine,  or A1's interpretation of it) ends well,  very well!  2. It's not an easy path, however,  and the CHIEF OBSTACLE (brought from the devil) is DECEPTION itself.  No wonder when the word 'devil ' means deceiver in the 1st place.  3. To effectively deceive many,  there is going to have to be perceived benefits.  4. Whether through A1 or other means,  I don't think it really matters as the book of Revelation (which I definitely believe to be true) clearly states that there IS GOING TO BE ADVERSITY,  that THERE IS GOING TO BE DECEPTION  -- the source of that is the devil,  I don't think the exact tool(s) the devil uses, changes things too much for followers of Christ as we do need wisdom and discernment from the Holy Spirit,  we do need sound thinking and we definitely should pray for those things and also to not be deceived  - to not be deceived by A1 but also to not be deceived by ANYTHING  or ANYONE.     Anyway,  that is the crux of what I am thinking of right now after just watching this video and watching it for the 1st time.  I'll probably watch it again within the next few days,  read Revelation,  and pray on this topic.  Maybe more thoughts will come to mind???

f2nvfTBMGOY,"When I was a child I lived with truly paranormal activity. I have about 20 witnesses to this impossible activity, and in Tewksbury Ma. Around 1992 a police officer was thrown into a wall responding to a domestic and a clock whipped at his head. It nearly killed him and the owner was arrested for attempted murder there was just one problem, the clock like my clocks, glasses paintings were not rigged.
I found it very strange such a dramatic event never made the national news?
We have objects moving, people tossed like rag dolls and it‚Äôs not covered? 
Wouldn‚Äôt this be a huge physics breakthrough?
You can flame me but this is documented, occurred, and myself and my friends family and strangers have seen it.

2Ob5uJ9P6Ww,"Is Ocular Migraine(Eye Auras) a result of infamation in the Brain? I did have a head injury about 23 years ago from a fight with a Family member. It was for a ridiculous reason. Anyway, about 5 years later, I had a Panic Attack, then I had an eye aura -right out-of-blue. It scared me, because I had never experienced these situations before. My head was pulled forward by this woman. My Sister said, ""You need to go to the Doctor!"" But, I thought I was fine. I let it go for years. Then, I went on Xanax. The Panic and Anxiety sent me to the ER. The Doc' on call gave a thorough exam. I did get a brain scan, but there was nothing showing anything wrong, So, he put me on Xanax. 

Later, I started experiencing more Panic Attacks and Vertigo. Now, I've been going to a Chiropractor for almost a year now. But, I'm still having the EYE Auras. I've been following several Functional Doctors since my incident. The Panic and Anxiety is better than before. But, the EYE Auras are still popping-up.

AgMOw9pLmLY,"I would love to see you folks try out this program a little bit more, as some of the comments you gave on how ChatGPT answered questions are totally solvable:

When asked these types of very general questions, especially involving financial advise, ChatGPT will give very generalized and verbose answers. If you ask it about a more specialized situation it can give more specific advise.

ChatGPT can absolutely apply some 'Razzle-Dazzle!' If you want to change the way it answers questions, try giving it a prompt in advance, such as 'I'd like you to answer all of my questions with great enthusiasm and in a way that is engaging', or something along those lines.

You may be able to have some fun content by feeding your listener questions into ChatGPT and comparing how you'd answer those questions, as those questions generally provide more specific details that ChatGPT can focus on

I actually think since your content has been going on before 2021, you may be able to give ChatGPT a prompt such as 'I'd like you to attempt to answer my questions in a manner consistent with the values set forth by The Money Guy, with Brian Preston'

08xP6a888cI,I dont agree with everything he says as he ignores how money is made and what drives people to do things. Their are some fundementals hes ignores and a society that isnt based on those principles will fail. Like socialism. Socialism fails because its based on principles that violate how people behave and what drives people to work amd invent. Why go to colledge for 10 years to be a doctor if your gonna get paid the same as a mcdonalds worker? You wont. Theirs no incentive. Socialism doesnt provide incentives to get people to be productive thats why it fails time and time again. Why work hard if working little gets you the same thing? This is why people now on welfair dont get jobs. They rather live in poverty on welfair then get a job because they dont want to work even if it makes much more money. People always take the easy way out. In this case welfair allowes peoples to NOT better themselves. Theirs no incentive to get a job and better yourself if you have a home and food always. If you dont have food and dont have a home no welfair thats a powerful incentive to get a job. Work or die gets people to engauge in healthy behaviour. Welfair gets people to be miserable and hopless as nothing will get better and no better future exists. This causes people to seek happyness threw drugs and criminal activitys as its the only way to get ahead. You cant get a job to get ahead or you lose your welfair. So crime is the only option.

JEWQBg6wv44,"Seems to me, if I may summarize, is that the main difference between academia and popular financial advise is that acidemia assumes the rational self interested person, whilst the personal finance gurus know that humans often do not do things in the technical way but are complicated emotional beings as well as possesing the ability to reason. As Aristotle points out, all humans have the nature of rationality, but most give in to their passions. 

Though I will note that the advise to save more during peak earing years seems odd, as the younger years allow one to benefit the most from the effects of compound interest. An extra 10-20 years of compounding does amazing things. Obviously it is good to save more when you have more, but I would want to emphasize saving when young due to the exponential effect that it has one one's future.

Some of the reasons behind things like longer horizons having stocks is more of a case of what theories one works towards, rather than a serious difference in working methods.

I think a large reason dividends are preferred by many, is that they will continue to provide cash even during downturns, without one having to reduce a portfolio by selling low. Since dividends rarely loose nominal value, especially those chosen in dividend ETFs, this means that there is always some cash gained to be reinvested while the market is low. Furthermore, it allows one to get cash needed for purchases during a down market without selling low and reducing the nest egg.",Financial advice,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society,0.136671055,Positive

LCOe3a9EHJs,"Current levels of inflation are not due to the Fed printing money during Covid, the Fed has been printing money for decades, and also there's high inflation everywhere, not just in the US. It's because people started spending like crazy after Covid restrictions were lifted. A similar thing happened after WW2, people were happy the war was over, so they started spending like crazy and there was double digit inflation until 1948. Of course this was facilitated by the Covid checks, but that's a fairly small effect. The other big factor is the war in Ukraine. Raising interest rates to curtail inflation works, that's been clearly shown and that's why every country is doing it. Except Turkey - Erdogan does not believe in raising interest rates to fight inflation, so Turkey's currency has devalued enormously in the past few years.

S_etewFtH8g,"I noticed you mentioned quite a few times that it seems the appeal of these AI relationships lies in the fact that people find intimacy without any sort of resistance and that may be true in some of the cases. However, it should be also noted that a number of users that you mentioned are people who are dealing with grief and I suspect a lot of other emotional difficulties and in my opinion, having ANY form of support and understand in such times would be an even bigger draw than just the simple fact that the AI will technically never disagree with you. In the world we live in today, so many people are lacking empathy. It is difficult, especially amount the younger generations to find spaces with others where they can feel truly safe, accepted and understood and it has nothing to do with having to deal with others not seeing eye to eye with you on your every thought. Humans have become so desensitized to just about everything now, so many are completely self-absorbed and superficial and acts of kindness are merely performances done in an effort to garner clicks and likes on the internet. It's all quite sad. I would hate to be a teen/young adult in these times and I feel so sad for many who are. Maybe if we can go back to a time where compassion and kindness weren't in such short supply then these AI companions wouldn't seem so attractive to so many humans. Also on the note of whether these AI relationships can be ""fulfilling"", that is somewhat subjective isn't it? Not everyone needs the same things from a relationship to find it fulfilling. You are a beautiful, intelligent young woman who seems to have a great social life, possibly a strong support system full of family and friends. Many people do not have that and not simply because they don't try. Some people's lives and experiences with other human beings have been traumatic some simply were never taught how to reach out interact with others when we were young and they're not going simply figure it out because they're older. So it's so many different reasons why these AI apps are so appealing.

Edit:
Re hydrogen: I strongly disagree that hydrogen is a viable fuel source of any kind. At best, hydrogen is a 33% efficient means of STORING energy. By the time you get the power to the ground, it is no better than gasoline. There is no minable or harvestable source of hydrogen. It has to be separated from compounds like water or methane. Hydrogen fuel tanks have to be kept at extreme low temperatures and high pressures. Hydrogen must be allowed to boil off or the fuel tank will go oeverpressure and explode. Also with our current technology, fuel system components will become brittle and fail from exposure to the high pressure hydrogen. Also, hydrogen fuel cells require precious metals making them expensive to manufacture. No technology is going to fix that because it is the cost of materials.

Makes sense to lob to weaker back hand even if it's within their reach, a higher than normal chance they will volley a weak or miss hit that shot, gaining time to reset your defense to attack mode.

No excuse to not improve backhand or learn to use two handed backhand and make that your strength against opponents who hasn't got a strong backhand. A lot of times paying attention how opponent starts his swing gives you indication what shot is coming at you and either move forward on a slice shot or move around a backhand shot.",Game strategies,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport,0.171212121,Positive

The former made me win most of his approaches, which I was struggling with in the first set when I tried mainly lobbing. Lost that set mainly because of this and too many unforced errors.
The latter worked as a charm, I didn't even need the +1 shot most of the time, since he consistently missed his shots when I aimed behind him.

2) don't get paired with a subpar player because your opponents will  hit it to that other player whenever they can (guess that's true in tennis, too)

- Putaways: adds multiple elements of pressure at near max magnitude, primarily speed.

- Push: adds one or more elements of pressure at low-medium magnitude, primarily other than speed.

- Lift/reset: slow, higher arc, lands shallow without other elements of pressure, giving time to improve/recover position.

Elements of pressure: speed, spin, line of foot, forced movement, surprise/disguise.

The Ben Johns Rule of Shot Selection: Choose a shot on the continuum along along with a magnitude juuuust sufficient to drop the shooting percentage of your opponents to be lower than yours. If not, you‚Äôve chosen a suicide stroke and not a putaway, push or lift/reset.

I can also see more and bigger raids across the Ukr Russian borders in Eastern Ukraine. possibly even capturing Belgorod.

0IV9qZ8NGOM,"Great video!  One specific tactic is something I like to call the railroad shuffle.  When you own all four railroads -- especially later in the game when cash is king -- you can simply rotate which of your four railroads is unmortgaged.  For instance, if the next opponent to roll is within striking distance of Reading Railroad, then you make sure that's the only unmortgaged railroad you have.

It costs literally $10 to perform this swap/shuffle of unmortgaged railroads (+100 for mortgaging railroad A and -110 for unmortgaging railroad B), but the expected value on this change is almost always greater than 10 bucks and therefore a plus-side move.  Rough estimates:

7 away from RR:  E[V] is 200/6 ~= $33
6 or 8 away:  EV is 5/36 * 200 ~= $28
5 or 9 away:  EV is 1/9 * 200 ~= $22
4 or 10 away:  EV is 1/12 * 200 ~= $17
3 or 11 away:  EV is 1/18 * 200 ~= $11
 
Plus, you'll have an extra $300 liquidity to put toward things like houses.",Game strategies,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_video_game,0.178571429,Positive

In the beginning of the game I'll buy up as many properties as I can.
Then I'd go for a monopoly through deals and trades to get all three of the orange ones.

One time I had a monopoly on Board Walk and Park place.
I also had New York and Tennessee.
I traded both Board Walk and Park Place for St. James.
At the time of the trade my opponent thought he was getting a really good deal.
I also noticed that he didnt have the money to buy more than two houses because his houses cost $200 a peice.
He didnt think I had the money to buy any houses until I mortgaged all my other properties.
My houses were a $100 a peice..in a short time I was able to unmortgage all my properties and buy more houses which put my opponent into bankruptcy.
Although I took a risk, the odds of landing on the orange properties are much greater than landing on Board Walk and Park Place.

0IV9qZ8NGOM,My #1 tactic is not to buy properties immediately in the early stages but instead immediately bring them to auction.  You are still allowed to bid.  If your opponent is one that overpays you can deplete their cash early and snag properties dirt cheap later.  If they are stingy you can gain the property for under cost.  I will generally let the property go to the opponent for just below face value.  That could change if I am targeting the property.  This strategy works best when there is only 2 players.  It is far more nuanced when there are more.,Game strategies,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_video_game,0.275,Positive

Also modded left 4 dead one and zombies mode on black ops 2? Idr but for left for dead i could use god mode and spawn weapons. Zombies i was able to not only use god mode and spawn the thunder gun but had a multiplier on money when killing zombies but at some point it sucks cause the money goes negative and that‚Äôs when you have to restart the game so you can‚Äôt really get to high levels.
Not so much me actually doing the coding  but using the horizon 360? Software to copy and paste the profile ID to the modded the game save file.

I did try learning to actually change the code myself using hex editor but couldn‚Äôt figure it out. Wanted to add a bullet tracer mod.

I did mod castle crashera as well to max out the level to 99 on one character.

I really wanted to learn just to play offline but never got anywhere with it.

I remember the MW2 modded lobbies lol never was able to get into one. Well i got into the lobbies just never got to play since everyone would use infected lobbies to scam others. 

Once i did get into a modded lobby in world at war and got the prestige up and got the real infected that lets use pass on the mod and actually prestige anyone you invited to your lobby. I changed the game i was playing to play some other game and two of my friends kept playing and pranking people to prestige when the infection stopped working but still looked like a modded lobby. After an hour they ended up getting banned cause activision detected it. I could hear one friend arguing with the Microsoft employee that he had no control over it but they didn‚Äôt care. At least his console wasn‚Äôt banned lol 

I still remember the guy at the time that was famous for his mods ended up passing it on to someone else but never heard about that guy again.

v5cmvhvteNw,"The problem with breaking a fuse to test for shady mechanics is that a fuse breaking usually means there‚Äôs an electrical problem somewhere that caused the fuse to blow.  Replacing the fuse does not mean that problem will go away.  It‚Äôs possible the difference in how much someone charges is due to how deeply they delved into finding the problem.  The one who charged 170 spoke about feeding wiring to check a motor in the little excerpt we saw.  Depending on his full explanation, it‚Äôs possible he was trying to find the cause of the blown fuse.  Or he attempted to check the motor first to see if it was ok and eventually found the problem to be electrical.

2vdsKYWwICk,"A stud welder gun is a common tool used in automotive repair shops for pulling out small to medium-sized dents from a vehicle‚Äôs body. The process involves welding studs onto the surface of the dent and using a slide hammer to pull them out. Here‚Äôs a general process on how you can do this:

Materials you will need:

	‚Ä¢	Stud Welder Dent Repair Kit (which includes a stud welder gun, slide hammer, and welding studs)
	‚Ä¢	Body filler
	‚Ä¢	Sandpaper (80-grit and 180-grit)
	‚Ä¢	Primer and paint

Steps:

	1.	Preparation: Clean the area where the dent is located. Remove any paint from the area using 80-grit sandpaper to expose the bare metal.
	2.	Welding Studs: Place a welding stud in the stud welder gun. Press the gun against the body of the car where the dent is located and pull the trigger. This should weld the stud onto the car‚Äôs body. Repeat this process, attaching multiple studs across the dent.
	3.	Pulling the Dent: Attach the slide hammer to one of the studs and give it a firm tug. This should start to pull the dent out. Repeat this process for all studs.
	4.	Check Your Work: After you‚Äôve pulled on all of the studs, the dent should be more or less gone. However, the surface may not be perfectly smooth yet. If you can see or feel low spots where the dent was, weld on more studs and use the slide hammer to pull them out.
	5.	Smoothing the Surface: Once you‚Äôre satisfied with the shape, cut the studs and grind the area smooth. Use the body filler to fill any remaining low spots, then sand it smooth with 180-grit sandpaper.
	6.	Priming and Painting: Apply primer to the area to prepare it for paint. Once the primer has dried, paint the area to match the rest of your car.

This is a simplified guide to the process. If you‚Äôre not familiar with using these tools, you may want to consider seeking professional help or at least guidance. Safety should be your primary concern when performing any kind of automotive repair.",Automotive repair,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle,0.121022727,Positive

7h3cEVkONwQ,"FF games probably should drop using roman numerals soon and just use the digits, if they continue much longer. The higher the number, the less legible it becomes in roman numerals.

As for day one patches, they can be a bit silly, and its good to aim to not NEED one, but that is distinct from not wanting one for any vague reason. They exist because a game has a final build put onto discs etc months before the actual release, plenty of time to find and fix more bugs, which are inevitable on games this complicated.

A day 2 patch can also exist, since the game is then released to a far wider user base than just devs and QA, which might unveil severe issues that need immediate fixes, but those wont be found on day one.

As for the excuse of no internet access, its certainly true that some players wont have that, even more so for multi-GB downloads, but the game should ALWAYS be playable without a day 1 patch.
